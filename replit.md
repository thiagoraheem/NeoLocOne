# Overview

NeoLoc One is a web-based enterprise application that serves as a modular platform for managing various business operations. The system uses a microservices-like architecture where individual modules (external applications) are integrated into a unified dashboard. The application provides role-based access control, user management, and secure authentication to control access to different modules based on user permissions.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management and React Context for authentication state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation schemas
- **Theme**: Custom NeoLoc branding with CSS variables and dark mode support

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Session Management**: Database-stored sessions with token-based authentication
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite middleware integration

## Database Design
- **Users Table**: Stores user credentials, roles (administrator, manager, operator, viewer), module access permissions, and account status
- **Modules Table**: Contains configuration for external applications including endpoints, ports, display information, and activation status
- **Sessions Table**: Manages user authentication sessions with JWT tokens and expiration tracking

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-tier Role System**: Four hierarchical roles with administrators having full access, followed by managers, operators, and viewers
- **Module-based Permissions**: Fine-grained access control where users can be granted access to specific modules
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token generation with configurable expiration and automatic session cleanup
- **Protected Routes**: Client-side route protection with role-based access control

## Module Integration System
- **External Module Management**: Modules are configured as separate applications running on different ports/endpoints
- **Dynamic Module Loading**: Modules are loaded based on user permissions and can be activated/deactivated administratively
- **Cross-origin Integration**: Modules are opened in new tabs/windows with authentication tokens passed for SSO

## Development & Deployment
- **Development Stack**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy, hot reloading, and TypeScript compilation
- **Build Process**: Vite builds the frontend, esbuild bundles the backend for production deployment
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit handles schema migrations and database structure changes
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-based configuration for database connections and JWT secrets
